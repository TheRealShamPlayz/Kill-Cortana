Hello! welcome to the readme file of this. You may have downloaded the exe version of this, which was converted from bat to exe, so im very sorry.
Here it is in the BATCH form.
Now onto what to do with this.
To use "killcortana.bat" just let it run in the background it will close cortana for you.
to use "delcortana.bat" confirm you want to delete "cortana.exe" and it will delete it (if it does not delete, run the file as an admin.)
